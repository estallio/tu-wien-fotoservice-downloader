# TU Wien Fotoservice Downloader
Downloads thumbnail images with watermarks in low resolution from a gallery of the TU Wien Fotoservice.

Just change the `password`, `galleryAddress` and `downloadFolder` variables in the `downloader.js` file and run `npm install && npm run start`. Be sure that Google's Puppeteer has access the Chromium.
